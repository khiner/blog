# My Portfolio

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
You can find the most recent version of the guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Pre-rendering into static HTML files based on `react-router` routes

I followed [this guide](https://medium.com/superhighfives/an-almost-static-stack-6df0a2791319) to get static HTML links and
and SEO titles working using `react-snapshot` and `react-helmet`.

## Linting and automatic styling

I followed [this guide](https://hackernoon.com/configure-eslint-prettier-and-flow-in-vs-code-for-react-development-c9d95db07213)
for a nice default eslint setup using [AirBnb's eslint rules](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/packages/eslint-config-airbnb#eslint-config-airbnb-1) and [prettier](https://prettier.io/), and made modifications to Prettier settings
in [package.json](package.json).
