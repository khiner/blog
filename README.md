# My Portfolio

This project was bootstrapped with [react-scripts-bootstrap-site-generator](https://github.com/khiner/react-scripts-bootstrap-site-generator),
a site generator I built as a `react-script` on top of [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

The only files not included in the site-generator above are the contents of [](/src/config.js), [](/src/entries.js) and the [](/src/content/) directory.

See the ['Setting up a new site'](https://github.com/khiner/react-scripts-bootstrap-site-generator#setting-up-a-new-site)
section in the site-generator README to see how to set up a similar site quickly.
