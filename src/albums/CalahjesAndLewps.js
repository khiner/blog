      I got a Korg Kaoss Mini in 2011 and one of the effects was this simple
      buffer looper. You could punch a loop in and out on the incoming audio and
      it would just start a totally dry loop. After that, the punch-in button
      would just overwrite the buffer with the incoming audio until you hit it
      again.

      I discovered I could put batteries in the Kaoss Mini and walk around town
      with it in a hoodie front pocket, shuffling through my iPod, mangling the
      audio through this thing and listening to it with earbuds.

      This whole album was made this way, evolving these loops by rhythmically
      punching in random snippets of audio with my iPod on shuffle.
