      DFT for Timeseries Data
    </a>{' '}
    is a Jupyter Notebook I developed for a presentation on applying the DFT to
    timeseries data for seasonality detection. The notebook attempts to build
    understanding one step at a time from a direct mathematical implementation
    and explanation of the DFT, to implementing frequency magnitude detection
    and approximate resynthesis. It includes chart animations to develop
    intuition.
