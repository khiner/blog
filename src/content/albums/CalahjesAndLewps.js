      I got a Korg Kaoss Mini in 2011 and one of the effects was this simple buffer looper. You could punch a loop in
      and out on the incoming audio and it would just start a totally dry loop. After that, the punch-in button would
      just overwrite the buffer with the incoming audio until you hit it again.

      I discovered I could put batteries in the Kaoss Mini and walk around town with it in a hoodie front pocket,
      shuffling through my iPod, mangling the audio through this thing and listening to it with earbuds.

      This whole album was made this way, evolving these loops by rhythmically punching in random snippets of audio with
      my iPod on shuffle.
