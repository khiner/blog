      Whoa actually making music?! Well, some curated bits of creative audio exploration. Mostly Eurorack modular jams,
      with some Prophet 6 and D-05. Each track is a different session performed live and recorded direct to stereo, then
      edited down, with no overdubbing. I didn't apply any effects other than some level adjustments, fading, and
      compression on some tracks. A few of these sound like more or less complete, cohesive pieces, but most are
      somewhat thin explorations of one sound or patch idea.

      I really like this way of working. Mixing in Eurorack and baking everything into stereo live can make for some
      terrible mixes, and lots of "what was I thinking" moments when listening back. But for me, the upsides more than
      make up for it:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>No mixing:</b> Completely do away with this entire tedious stage of music production. No endless
        perfectionistic tweaking and reworking until I lose all perspective.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>No arranging:</b> When I used to work entirely in the box in Ableton, I would spend probably 5-10% of my time
        on the actual source material and spend the rest of my time exploring combinations, micro-editing, looping,
        arranging, etc., often until I've completely lost track of the original idea and it ends up as another
        unfinished project sitting on my hard drive. More often than not, this feels like work and strangles the life
        out of a fun, spontaneous idea. It also takes a ton of work to keep things sounding dynamic and evolving, and
        not too clinical. When I know I'm going to use the raw stereo recording of a session, I'm forced to only explore
        a few combinations, variations, mixes, etc., and either manually tweak knobs to move across these zones or find
        a way to automate it with patching. Sometimes the best moments happen in this process, and the transitions can
        sound happily imperfect, messy, uneven, offbeat/offkey, or totally messed up and wrong.

        <b>Separate the musician and the critic:</b> Making music and editing/mixing/mastering music are two very
        different activities, occupying very different head spaces. Music making is a creative act, and creativity is an
        intuitive, explorative, flowing, noncritical kind of thing. You can only find good ideas if you let yourself
        explore lots of bad ones in the process. Editing, on the other hand, is an analytical activity best done
        critically and ruthlessly. I find myself enjoying both sides of this process much more when they're strictly
        separated. Whenever I make music in a DAW, I can't help but constantly hop back and forth between these two
        kinds of activities, and both sides suffer. When I instead jam and explore for extended sessions and only later
        sit down with a long stereo track and focus solely on whittling it down to the best bits, I can fully engage
        with both aspects of the process, and I feel much more productive.

        <b>Have Fun:</b> Making music in a DAW has a way of tricking me into thinking I'm making <i>tracks</i> for an{' '}
        <i>album</i> that somebody else is going listen to. When I record Eurorack jams to stereo out, I instead spend
        100% of my time exploring, trying things out, listening, learning, getting surprised, and generally having a
        blast :) It helps me enjoy the process of making music without worrying about any final product.
